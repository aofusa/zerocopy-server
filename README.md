# Veil - High-Performance Reverse Proxy Server

A high-performance reverse proxy server using io_uring (monoio) and rustls.

## Features

### Core Features
- **Asynchronous I/O**: Efficient I/O processing with monoio (io_uring)
- **TLS**: Memory-safe pure Rust TLS implementation with rustls
- **kTLS**: Kernel TLS offload support via rustls + ktls2 (Linux 5.15+)
- **HTTP/2**: HTTP/2 support via TLS ALPN negotiation (stream multiplexing, HPACK compression)
- **HTTP/3**: QUIC/UDP-based HTTP/3 support using quiche (0-RTT connection establishment)
- **Fast Allocator**: High-speed memory allocation with mimalloc + Huge Pages support
- **Fast Routing**: O(log n) path matching with Radix Tree (matchit)

### Proxy Features
- **Connection Pool**: Latency reduction through backend connection reuse (HTTP/HTTPS support)
- **Load Balancing**: Request distribution to multiple backends (Round Robin/Least Connections/IP Hash)
- **Health Check**: Automatic failover with HTTP-based active health checks
- **WebSocket Support**: Bidirectional proxy with Upgrade header detection (Fixed/Adaptive polling modes)
- **H2C (HTTP/2 over cleartext)**: HTTP/2 backend connection without TLS (gRPC support)
- **Header Manipulation**: Add/remove request/response headers (X-Real-IP, HSTS, etc.)
- **Redirect**: 301/302/307/308 HTTP redirects (with path preservation option)
- **SNI Configuration**: Specify SNI name when connecting to HTTPS backends via IP (virtual host support)

### HTTP Processing
- **Keep-Alive**: Full HTTP/1.1 Keep-Alive support
- **Chunked Transfer**: RFC 7230 compliant chunked decoder (state machine based)
- **Buffer Pool**: Reduced memory allocation

### Performance
- **CPU Affinity**: Pin worker threads to CPU cores
- **CBPF Distribution**: Client IP-based load balancing with SO_REUSEPORT (Linux 4.6+)

### Operations
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Safe termination via SIGINT/SIGTERM
- **Graceful Reload**: Hot reload configuration via SIGHUP (zero downtime)
- **Async Logging**: High-performance async logging with ftlog
- **Config Validation**: Detailed configuration file validation at startup
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Export request counts, latency, etc. via metrics endpoint (requires configuration, disabled by default)

### Security
- **HTTP to HTTPS Redirect**: Automatic 301 redirect from HTTP to HTTPS
- **Connection Limit**: Global concurrent connection limit
- **Rate Limiter**: Sliding window rate limiting
- **IP Restriction**: IP address filtering with CIDR support
- **Privilege Dropping**: Drop to unprivileged user after root startup
- **seccomp Filter**: BPF-based system call restriction (optional)
- **Landlock Sandbox**: Filesystem access restriction (Linux 5.13+)
- **systemd Sandbox**: Namespace isolation and system call restriction support

## Build

```bash
# Standard build (using rustls, HTTP/1.1 only)
cargo build --release

# Build with kTLS support (rustls + ktls2)
cargo build --release --features ktls

# Build with HTTP/2 support
cargo build --release --features http2

# Build with HTTP/3 support (using quiche)
cargo build --release --features http3

# All protocols support (HTTP/2 + HTTP/3)
cargo build --release --features all-protocols

# kTLS + HTTP/2 (recommended configuration)
cargo build --release --features "ktls,http2"

# Full build (kTLS + all protocols)
cargo build --release --features "ktls,all-protocols"
```

After building, the binary is generated at `target/release/veil`.

### Feature Flags

| Feature | Description | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `ktls` | kTLS kernel offload | Linux 5.15+, requires `modprobe tls` |
| `http2` | HTTP/2 (ALPN h2) | HTTP/2 support for TLS connections |
| `http3` | HTTP/3 (QUIC) | UDP/QUIC based, uses quiche |
| `all-protocols` | http2 + http3 | Enable all protocols |

> **Note**: HTTP/3 is UDP-based, so it cannot be used with kTLS (HTTP/3 does not use TCP/TLS).

## Startup

```bash
# Start with default config file (/etc/veil/config.toml)
./veil

# Start with specified config file
./veil -c /path/to/config.toml
./veil --config /path/to/config.toml

# Show help
./veil --help

# Show version
./veil --version
```

### Command Line Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-c, --config <PATH>` | Path to config file | `/etc/veil/config.toml` |
| `-h, --help` | Show help message | - |
| `-V, --version` | Show version information | - |

## HTTP to HTTPS Redirect

This feature automatically redirects HTTP access to HTTPS.

### Configuration

```toml
[server]
listen = "0.0.0.0:443"
http = "0.0.0.0:80"  # Enable HTTP redirect
```

### Behavior

- Access to `http://example.com/path` is redirected to `https://example.com/path` with 301
- Domain name is extracted from the Host header to construct the redirect URL
- Port numbers are automatically removed (uses HTTPS default port 443)

### Security Considerations

- **Redirect Only**: HTTP only performs redirects, no content is served
- **301 Moved Permanently**: Browsers cache the redirect destination, subsequent requests go directly to HTTPS
- **First Access**: Plain text communication occurs only on the first HTTP access, but no content is included

### Notes

- Using privileged port (80) requires one of the following:
  1. Start as root (recommend using with privilege dropping)
  2. Grant `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability

```bash
# To grant capability
sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' ./target/release/veil
```

## TLS Certificate Generation

To generate a self-signed certificate for development/testing, run the following commands:

```bash
# Generate ECDSA private key (secp384r1)
openssl genpkey -algorithm EC -out server.key -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:secp384r1 -pkeyopt ec_param_enc:named_curve

# Generate self-signed certificate (valid for 365 days)
openssl req -new -x509 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -subj "/CN=localhost/O=Development/C=JP"
```

Specify the generated files in `config.toml`:

```toml
[tls]
cert_path = "./server.crt"
key_path = "./server.key"
```

> **Note**: In production, use certificates issued by a certificate authority such as Let's Encrypt.

## TLS Library

### rustls (Default)

- Memory-safe pure Rust implementation
- No additional dependencies
- Default when not using kTLS

### rustls + ktls2 (`--features ktls`)

- Performs TLS handshake with rustls
- After handshake completion, offloads to kTLS via ktls2
- No additional external dependencies (pure Rust implementation)

```bash
# Build
cargo build --release --features ktls
```

## Configuration

By default, `/etc/veil/config.toml` is loaded.
Use the `-c` or `--config` option to specify a different path.

Configuration file example (`config.toml`):

```toml
[server]
listen = "0.0.0.0:443"
# HTTP to HTTPS redirect (optional)
# Automatically redirect HTTP access to HTTPS (301 Moved Permanently)
http = "0.0.0.0:80"
# Number of worker threads (optional)
# If unspecified or 0, uses the same number of threads as CPU cores
threads = 4
# Enable HTTP/2 (only when built with --features http2)
http2_enabled = true
# Enable HTTP/3 (only when built with --features http3)
http3_enabled = true

[logging]
# Log level: "trace", "debug", "info", "warn", "error", "off"

# Landlock filesystem restriction (Linux 5.13+)
enable_landlock = true
landlock_read_paths = ["/etc/veil", "/usr", "/lib", "/lib64"]
landlock_write_paths = ["/var/log/veil"]

[performance]
# SO_REUSEPORT distribution method
# "kernel" = kernel default (3-tuple hash)
# "cbpf"   = client IP-based CBPF (improved cache efficiency, requires Linux 4.6+)
reuseport_balancing = "cbpf"

# Use Huge Pages (Large OS Pages)
# 5-10% performance improvement by reducing TLB misses
huge_pages_enabled = true

[tls]
cert_path = "/path/to/cert.pem"
key_path = "/path/to/key.pem"
ktls_enabled = true         # Enable kTLS (Linux 5.15+, requires feature flag)
ktls_fallback_enabled = true # Fallback to rustls on kTLS failure (default: true)

# Host-based routing
[host_routes."example.com"]
type = "File"
path = "/var/www/example"
mode = "sendfile"

[host_routes."api.example.com"]
type = "Proxy"
url = "http://localhost:8080"

# Path-based routing

# Static file (exact match)
[path_routes."example.com"."/robots.txt"]
type = "File"
path = "/var/www/robots.txt"

# Directory serving (with trailing slash)
[path_routes."example.com"."/static/"]
type = "File"
path = "/var/www/assets/"
mode = "sendfile"

# Directory serving (without trailing slash - same behavior, no redirect)
[path_routes."example.com"."/docs"]
type = "File"
path = "/var/www/docs/"

# Custom index file
[path_routes."example.com"."/user/"]
type = "File"
path = "/var/www/user/"
index = "profile.html"

# Proxy (with trailing slash)
[path_routes."example.com"."/api/"]
type = "Proxy"
url = "http://localhost:8080/app/"

# Proxy (without trailing slash - same behavior)
[path_routes."example.com"."/backend"]
type = "Proxy"
url = "http://localhost:3000"

# Root
[path_routes."example.com"."/"]
type = "File"
path = "/var/www/index.html"
```

## Routing

### Routing Priority

1. **Host-based routing** (`[host_routes]`): Exact match on Host header
2. **Path-based routing** (`[path_routes."hostname"]`): Longest path match (Radix Tree)

### Backend Types

| Type | Description | Configuration Example |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `Proxy` | HTTP reverse proxy (single) | `{ type = "Proxy", url = "http://localhost:8080" }` |
| `Proxy` | HTTP reverse proxy (LB) | `{ type = "Proxy", upstream = "backend-pool" }` |
| `Proxy` | HTTPS proxy (with SNI) | `{ type = "Proxy", url = "https://192.168.1.100", sni_name = "api.example.com" }` |
| `File` | Static file serving | `{ type = "File", path = "/var/www", mode = "sendfile" }` |
| `Redirect` | HTTP redirect | `{ type = "Redirect", redirect_url = "https://new.example.com", redirect_status = 301 }` |

> **Note**: `Proxy` type uses either `url` (single backend) or `upstream` (load balancing). WebSocket is automatically supported for both. When connecting to HTTPS backends via IP, you can specify the SNI name with `sni_name`.

### Routing Behavior (Nginx-style)

#### 1. Static File (Exact Match)

If `path` in the configuration is a file, the file is returned only when the request path matches exactly.

```toml
# /robots.txt → returns /var/www/robots.txt
# /robots.txt/extra → 404 Not Found (cannot traverse below a file)
[path_routes."example.com"."/robots.txt"]
type = "File"
path = "/var/www/robots.txt"
```

#### 2. Directory Serving (Alias Behavior)

If `path` in the configuration is a directory, the remaining path after removing the prefix is joined to the directory.
**Trailing slash is optional** (both behave the same).

```toml
# With trailing slash (traditional style)
[path_routes."example.com"."/static/"]
type = "File"
path = "/var/www/assets/"

# Without trailing slash (same behavior, no 301 redirect)
[path_routes."example.com"."/docs"]
type = "File"
path = "/var/www/docs/"
```

| Request | Configuration | Resolved Path |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| `/static/css/style.css` | `"/static/"` | `/var/www/assets/css/style.css` |
| `/static/` | `"/static/"` | `/var/www/assets/index.html` |
| `/docs` | `"/docs"` | `/var/www/docs/index.html` *returned directly |
| `/docs/` | `"/docs"` | `/var/www/docs/index.html` |
| `/docs/guide/intro.html` | `"/docs"` | `/var/www/docs/guide/intro.html` |

#### 3. Index File Specification

Use the `index` option to specify the file returned when accessing a directory.
Defaults to `index.html` if not specified.

```toml
# /user/ → returns /var/www/user/profile.html
[path_routes."example.com"."/user/"]
type = "File"
path = "/var/www/user/"
index = "profile.html"

# /app/ → returns /var/www/app/dashboard.html
[path_routes."example.com"."/app/"]
type = "File"
path = "/var/www/app/"
index = "dashboard.html"
```

#### 4. Proxy (Proxy Pass Behavior)

The remaining path after removing the prefix is joined to the backend URL.
**Trailing slash is optional**.

```toml
# With trailing slash
[path_routes."example.com"."/api/"]
type = "Proxy"
url = "http://localhost:8080/app/"

# Without trailing slash (same behavior)
[path_routes."example.com"."/backend"]
type = "Proxy"
url = "http://localhost:3000"
```

| Request | Configuration | Forwarded To |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| `/api/v1/users` | `"/api/"` → `url = ".../app/"` | `http://localhost:8080/app/v1/users` |
| `/backend` | `"/backend"` → `url = ".../"` | `http://localhost:3000/` |
| `/backend/users` | `"/backend"` | `http://localhost:3000/users` |

### File Serving Mode

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `sendfile` | Zero-copy transfer via sendfile system call | Large files, videos, images |
| `memory` | Load file into memory for delivery | Small files, favicon.ico, etc. |

```toml
# Directory serving (sendfile mode)
[path_routes."example.com"."/static/"]
type = "File"
path = "/var/www/static"
mode = "sendfile"

# Single file serving (memory mode)
[path_routes."example.com"."/favicon.ico"]
type = "File"
path = "/var/www/favicon.ico"
mode = "memory"

# Default when type and mode are omitted (type = "File", mode = "sendfile")
[path_routes."example.com"."/"]
path = "/var/www/html"
```

### Proxy Configuration

Supports proxying to HTTP and HTTPS backends:

```toml
# HTTP backend
[path_routes."example.com"."/api/"]
type = "Proxy"
url = "http://localhost:8080"

# HTTPS backend (TLS client connection)
[path_routes."example.com"."/secure/"]
type = "Proxy"
url = "https://backend.example.com"
```

### H2C (HTTP/2 over cleartext) Proxy

When the backend supports H2C (HTTP/2 without TLS), specify `use_h2c = true` to communicate via HTTP/2.

```toml
# H2C connection to gRPC backend
[path_routes."example.com"."/grpc/"]
type = "Proxy"
url = "http://localhost:50051"
use_h2c = true
```

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `use_h2c` | Use H2C (HTTP/2 without TLS) | false |

**H2C Use Cases:**
- Connecting to gRPC backends (internal network)
- Leverage HTTP/2 multiplexing and header compression for backend communication
- Uses Prior Knowledge mode (not via Upgrade)

> **Note**: H2C cannot be used with HTTPS backends (TLS connections). Use only in environments where TLS is not required, such as gRPC communication within internal networks.

#### SNI (Server Name Indication) Configuration

When connecting to HTTPS backends, you can specify a domain name for SNI even when the backend is specified by IP address.
This allows obtaining the correct certificate even from servers with virtual host configurations.

```toml
# IP address specification + SNI name
[path_routes."example.com"."/internal-api/"]
type = "Proxy"
url = "https://192.168.1.100:443"
sni_name = "api.internal.example.com"
```

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `sni_name` | SNI name for TLS connection (uses URL hostname if omitted) | URL hostname |

> **Note**: When `sni_name` is specified, TLS certificate verification is also performed against that name. The backend server's certificate must include the specified domain name (or wildcard).

### Load Balancing Configuration

Request distribution to multiple backends:

```toml
# Define upstream group
[upstreams."api-pool"]
algorithm = "round_robin"  # or "least_conn", "ip_hash"
servers = [
  "http://api1:8080",
  "http://api2:8080",
  "http://api3:8080"
]

  # Health check (optional)
  [upstreams."api-pool".health_check]
  interval_secs = 10
  path = "/health"
  timeout_secs = 5
  healthy_statuses = [200]
  unhealthy_threshold = 3
  healthy_threshold = 2

# Route referencing upstream
[path_routes."example.com"."/api/"]
type = "Proxy"
upstream = "api-pool"
```

#### SNI Configuration in Upstream

Upstream server entries support both string and struct formats.
Using struct format allows specifying SNI names when using IP addresses.

```toml
# HTTPS backend pool (with SNI name specification)
[upstreams."https-pool"]
algorithm = "least_conn"
servers = [
  # Struct format: IP address + SNI name
  { url = "https://192.168.1.100:443", sni_name = "api.example.com" },
  { url = "https://192.168.1.101:443", sni_name = "api.example.com" },
  # String format: domain name specification (SNI name automatically uses URL hostname)
  "https://api.example.com:443"
]

# Route referencing upstream
[path_routes."example.com"."/api/"]
type = "Proxy"
upstream = "https-pool"
```

> **Note**: String and struct formats can be mixed within the same array. The traditional string format continues to work for backward compatibility.

### WebSocket Configuration

WebSocket is automatically supported with regular Proxy. Polling behavior during bidirectional transfer can be customized via configuration.

#### Basic Configuration

```toml
# WebSocket application
[path_routes."example.com"."/ws/"]
type = "Proxy"
url = "http://localhost:3000"

# WebSocket with load balancing
[path_routes."example.com"."/ws-lb/"]
type = "Proxy"
upstream = "websocket-pool"
```

#### Polling Mode Configuration

Controls polling behavior during WebSocket bidirectional transfer.

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `websocket_poll_mode` | Polling mode (`"fixed"` / `"adaptive"`) | `"adaptive"` |
| `websocket_poll_timeout_ms` | Initial timeout (milliseconds) | 1 |
| `websocket_poll_max_timeout_ms` | Maximum timeout (milliseconds) *adaptive only | 100 |
| `websocket_poll_backoff_multiplier` | Backoff multiplier *adaptive only | 2.0 |

#### Choosing Polling Mode

| Mode | Behavior | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| `fixed` | Always uses fixed timeout | Real-time games, low latency priority |
| `adaptive` | Short when active, longer when idle | Chat, monitoring dashboards, balance focused |

**Adaptive Mode Behavior:**

```
Data transferred → Reset timeout (return to initial value)
Timeout occurred → Timeout × multiplier (extend up to max)

Example: initial=1ms, max=100ms, multiplier=2.0
1ms → 2ms → 4ms → 8ms → 16ms → 32ms → 64ms → 100ms (stops at max)
↓ When data arrives
1ms (reset)
```

#### WebSocket Configuration Examples

```toml
# Real-time game (low latency priority)
[path_routes."game.example.com"."/ws/"]
type = "Proxy"
url = "http://localhost:3000"

  [path_routes."game.example.com"."/ws/".security]
  websocket_poll_mode = "fixed"
  websocket_poll_timeout_ms = 1

# Chat application (balance focused)
[path_routes."chat.example.com"."/ws/"]
type = "Proxy"
url = "http://localhost:3001"

  [path_routes."chat.example.com"."/ws/".security]
  websocket_poll_mode = "adaptive"
  websocket_poll_timeout_ms = 1
  websocket_poll_max_timeout_ms = 50
  websocket_poll_backoff_multiplier = 2.0

# Monitoring dashboard (CPU efficiency priority)
[path_routes."monitor.example.com"."/ws/"]
type = "Proxy"
url = "http://localhost:3002"

  [path_routes."monitor.example.com"."/ws/".security]
  websocket_poll_mode = "adaptive"
  websocket_poll_timeout_ms = 10
  websocket_poll_max_timeout_ms = 200
  websocket_poll_backoff_multiplier = 1.5

sandbox_ro_bind_mounts = ["/usr:/usr", "/lib:/lib", "/lib64:/lib64"]
sandbox_tmpfs_mounts = ["/tmp"]
```

> **Note**: Setting `sandbox_unshare_net = true` will disable network communication. For reverse proxies, typically leave this as `false`.

> **Note**: When using privileged ports (below 1024), either grant `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability or use unprivileged ports.
>
> ```bash
> sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' ./target/release/veil

# Security settings for API
[path_routes."example.com"."/api/"]
type = "Proxy"
url = "http://localhost:8080/app/"

  [path_routes."example.com"."/api/".security]
  allowed_methods = ["GET", "POST", "PUT"]
  max_request_body_size = 5_242_880  # 5MB
  backend_connect_timeout_secs = 5
  rate_limit_requests_per_min = 60

# Admin API with IP restriction
[path_routes."example.com"."/admin/"]
type = "Proxy"
url = "http://localhost:9000/"

  [path_routes."example.com"."/admin/".security]
  allowed_ips = [
    "192.168.0.0/16",
    "10.0.0.0/8",
    "127.0.0.1"
  ]
  denied_ips = ["192.168.1.100"]
  allowed_methods = ["GET", "POST"]
```

#### IP Restriction Evaluation Order

IP restrictions are evaluated in **deny → allow** order (deny takes priority).

1. Matches `denied_ips` → Reject (403 Forbidden)
2. `allowed_ips` is empty → Allow
3. Matches `allowed_ips` → Allow
4. Otherwise → Reject (403 Forbidden)

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Single IPv4 | `192.168.1.1` |
| IPv4 CIDR | `192.168.0.0/24` |
| Single IPv6 | `::1` |
| IPv6 CIDR | `2001:db8::/32` |

## Header Manipulation

Add or remove request/response headers. Configure security headers such as X-Real-IP, X-Forwarded-Proto, HSTS, etc.

### Request Header Manipulation

Add or remove headers before forwarding to the backend.

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `add_request_headers` | Headers to add (table format) | `{ "X-Real-IP" = "$client_ip" }` |
| `remove_request_headers` | Headers to remove (array) | `["X-Debug-Token"]` |

#### Special Variables

The following variables can be used in `add_request_headers` values:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `$client_ip` | Client IP address |
| `$host` | Host header from request |
| `$request_uri` | Request URI (path + query string) |

### Response Header Manipulation

Add or remove headers before sending to the client. Also applies to static file serving.

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `add_response_headers` | Headers to add | `{ "Strict-Transport-Security" = "max-age=31536000" }` |
| `remove_response_headers` | Headers to remove | `["Server", "X-Powered-By"]` |

### Configuration Example

```toml
# Proxy with security headers
[path_routes."example.com"."/api/"]
type = "Proxy"
url = "http://localhost:8080"

  [path_routes."example.com"."/api/".security]
  # Add before forwarding to backend
  add_request_headers = { "X-Real-IP" = "$client_ip", "X-Forwarded-Proto" = "https" }
  # Remove before forwarding to backend
  remove_request_headers = ["X-Debug-Token", "X-Internal-Auth"]
  # Add before sending to client (security headers)
  add_response_headers = { "Strict-Transport-Security" = "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains", "X-Frame-Options" = "DENY", "X-Content-Type-Options" = "nosniff" }
  # Remove before sending to client
  remove_response_headers = ["X-Powered-By"]
```

## Redirect

Configure HTTP redirects (301/302/303/307/308). Use for non-WWW handling, HTTPS enforcement, legacy URL migration, etc.

### Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `redirect_url` | Redirect destination URL (required) | - |
| `redirect_status` | Status code (301, 302, 303, 307, 308) | 301 |
| `preserve_path` | Append original path to redirect destination | false |

### Status Code Usage

| Code | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 301 | Moved Permanently | Permanent relocation (SEO preservation) |
| 302 | Found | Temporary redirect |
| 303 | See Other | POST to GET redirect |
| 307 | Temporary Redirect | Temporary (preserves method) |
| 308 | Permanent Redirect | Permanent (preserves method) |

### Configuration Examples

```toml
# Redirect to WWW
[path_routes."example.com"."/"]
type = "Redirect"
redirect_url = "https://www.example.com/"
redirect_status = 301

# Legacy URL to new URL migration (preserve path)
[path_routes."example.com"."/legacy/"]
type = "Redirect"
redirect_url = "https://example.com/v2"
redirect_status = 301
preserve_path = true
# /legacy/users → https://example.com/v2/users
# /legacy/api/data → https://example.com/v2/api/data

# Force HTTP to HTTPS redirect (configured on different host)
[path_routes."http.example.com"."/"]
type = "Redirect"
redirect_url = "https://example.com$request_uri"
redirect_status = 301
```

### Special Variables

The following variables can be used in `redirect_url`:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `$request_uri` | Original request URI |
| `$path` | Path portion after prefix removal |

## Prometheus Metrics

Export metrics such as request counts, latency, and body sizes in Prometheus format.

### Enabling

Prometheus metrics are **disabled** by default. They must be explicitly enabled in the `[prometheus]` section.

```toml
[prometheus]
enabled = true
```

> **Note**: Metrics are also disabled if the `[prometheus]` section itself does not exist.

### Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `enabled` | Enable metrics endpoint | **false** |
| `path` | Metrics endpoint path | `/__metrics` |
| `allowed_ips` | Allowed IP/CIDR for access (array) | [] (all allowed) |

### Endpoint

```
GET /__metrics
```

Use the `path` option to change the endpoint path.

### Available Metrics

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `veil_proxy_http_requests_total` | Counter | method, status, host | Total request count |
| `veil_proxy_http_request_duration_seconds` | Histogram | method, host | Request processing time (seconds) |
| `veil_proxy_http_request_size_bytes` | Histogram | - | Request body size |
| `veil_proxy_http_response_size_bytes` | Histogram | - | Response body size |
| `veil_proxy_http_active_connections` | Gauge | host | Active connection count |
| `veil_proxy_http_upstream_health` | Gauge | upstream, server | Upstream health status (1=healthy, 0=unhealthy) |

### Grafana Dashboard Examples

```promql
# Request rate (requests/second)
rate(veil_proxy_http_requests_total[5m])

# Error rate (4xx + 5xx)
sum(rate(veil_proxy_http_requests_total{status=~"4..|5.."}[5m])) 
  / sum(rate(veil_proxy_http_requests_total[5m]))

# Latency P95
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(veil_proxy_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))

# Request rate by host
sum by (host) (rate(veil_proxy_http_requests_total[5m]))
```

### Configuration Examples (config.toml)

```toml
# Basic configuration (accessible from all IPs)
[prometheus]
enabled = true
path = "/__metrics"

# Enhanced security (internal network only)
[prometheus]
enabled = true
path = "/metrics"
allowed_ips = [
  "127.0.0.1",
  "::1",
  "10.0.0.0/8",
  "172.16.0.0/12",
  "192.168.0.0/16"
]
```

### Access Control

When `allowed_ips` is configured, only the specified IP addresses/CIDRs can access the metrics endpoint.
When empty (default), all IPs can access.

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Single IPv4 | `127.0.0.1` |
| IPv4 CIDR | `10.0.0.0/8` |
| Single IPv6 | `::1` |
| IPv6 CIDR | `2001:db8::/32` |

### Prometheus Configuration Example

```yaml
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'veil-proxy'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['your-proxy-server:443']
    scheme: https
    tls_config:
      insecure_skip_verify: true  # For self-signed certificates
    metrics_path: /__metrics
```

## HTTP/2 Support

Supports HTTP/2 (RFC 7540) via TLS ALPN negotiation.

### Features

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Stream Multiplexing | Parallel processing of multiple requests on a single connection |
| HPACK Header Compression | Significantly reduces header overhead |
| Server Push | Latency reduction through proactive resource sending |
| Flow Control | Stream and connection level control |

### Enabling

```bash
# Build with HTTP/2 feature
cargo build --release --features http2
```

```toml
# config.toml
[server]
listen = "0.0.0.0:443"
http2_enabled = true  # Enable HTTP/2 (ALPN h2)
```

### Advanced Configuration

Configure detailed HTTP/2 protocol parameters in the `[http2]` section:

```toml
[http2]
# HPACK dynamic table size (default: 65536)
header_table_size = 65536

# Concurrent streams (default: 256)
max_concurrent_streams = 256

# Stream window size (default: 1048576 = 1MB)
initial_window_size = 1048576

# Maximum frame size (default: 65536)
max_frame_size = 65536

# Maximum header list size (default: 65536)
max_header_list_size = 65536

# Connection window size (default: 1048576 = 1MB)
connection_window_size = 1048576
```

### HTTP/1.1 Fallback

Clients that don't support HTTP/2 automatically fall back to HTTP/1.1.

## HTTP/3 Support

Supports HTTP/3 (RFC 9114) based on QUIC/UDP. Uses Cloudflare's [quiche](https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche).

### Features

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| 0-RTT Connection Establishment | Instant communication without TLS handshake |
| Head-of-Line Blocking Elimination | Packet loss doesn't affect other streams |
| Connection Migration | Maintains connection during network switches |
| GSO/GRO Optimization | High-performance UDP processing |

### Enabling

```bash
# Build with HTTP/3 feature
cargo build --release --features http3
```

```toml
# config.toml
[server]
listen = "0.0.0.0:443"
http3_enabled = true  # Enable HTTP/3 (QUIC/UDP)
```

### Advanced Configuration

Configure detailed HTTP/3 (QUIC) protocol parameters in the `[http3]` section:

```toml
[http3]
# HTTP/3 listen address (UDP, defaults to server.listen if unspecified)
listen = "0.0.0.0:443"

# Maximum idle timeout (milliseconds, default: 30000)
max_idle_timeout = 30000

# Maximum UDP payload size (default: 1350)
max_udp_payload_size = 1350

# Initial maximum data size (entire connection, default: 10000000)
initial_max_data = 10000000

# Initial maximum bidirectional streams
initial_max_streams_bidi = 100

# Initial maximum unidirectional streams
initial_max_streams_uni = 100
```

### Notes

- HTTP/3 is UDP-based, so **kTLS cannot be used** (doesn't use TCP)
- UDP port 443 must be opened in the firewall
- Use Alt-Svc header to notify browsers of HTTP/3 support

## kTLS (Kernel TLS) Support

### Overview

kTLS is a Linux kernel feature that performs TLS data transfer phase encryption/decryption at the kernel level.
This project supports kTLS using rustls + ktls2.

### Performance Improvements

| Aspect | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| CPU Usage | 20-40% reduction (under high load) |
| Throughput | Up to 2x improvement |
| Latency | Reduced context switches |
| Zero-Copy | sendfile + TLS encryption |

### Enabling Procedure

```bash
# 1. Load kernel module
sudo modprobe tls

# 2. Build with ktls feature
cargo build --release --features ktls

# 3. Enable in config file (config.toml)
# [tls]
# ktls_enabled = true
# ktls_fallback_enabled = true  # optional
```

### Fallback Configuration

Control behavior when kTLS activation fails with `ktls_fallback_enabled`:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `true` (default) | Continue with rustls on kTLS failure (graceful degradation) |
| `false` | kTLS required mode (reject connection on failure) |

**Benefits of disabling fallback (`ktls_fallback_enabled = false`):**

| Aspect | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Performance Predictability | All connections guaranteed to use kTLS |
| Debug Ease | No mixed kTLS/rustls state |
| Early Environment Detection | Immediate failure when kTLS unavailable |

**Note:** When fallback is disabled, connections will fail in environments where kTLS is unavailable.
Verify the kernel module is loaded with `modprobe tls` beforehand.

```toml
[tls]
cert_path = "/path/to/cert.pem"
key_path = "/path/to/key.pem"
ktls_enabled = true
ktls_fallback_enabled = false  # kTLS required mode
```

### Requirements

- Linux 5.15 or higher (recommended, but works on earlier versions)
- `tls` kernel module loaded
- AES-GCM cipher suites (TLS 1.2/1.3)
- Built with ktls feature (`--features ktls`)

### Implementation Status

**With ktls feature enabled (`--features ktls`):**
- ✅ kTLS kernel module availability check
- ✅ Automatic kTLS activation after TLS handshake completion
- ✅ kTLS offload for both TX and RX
- ✅ Full async integration with monoio (io_uring)

**Default build (using rustls):**
- ❌ kTLS is not supported
- 👉 Build with `--features ktls` to use kTLS

### Security Considerations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Kernel Bugs | Pin kernel version, apply patches regularly |
| Session Key Exposure | TLS handshake runs in userspace (rustls) (maintains PFS) |
| DoS Attacks | Monitor kernel resources, rate limiting |

## Performance Tuning

### Worker Thread Count

Configure worker thread count in the `[server]` section of `config.toml`.

```toml
[server]
listen = "0.0.0.0:443"
threads = 0  # If unspecified or 0, uses same number as CPU cores
```

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Unspecified | Same number of threads as CPU cores |
| `threads = 0` | Same number of threads as CPU cores |
| `threads = 4` | Start with 4 threads |

- Each worker thread is pinned to a CPU core (CPU affinity)
- If thread count exceeds core count, assigned round-robin
- Recommend setting lower in memory-constrained environments

### SO_REUSEPORT CBPF Load Balancing

#### Overview

When multiple worker threads listen on the same port using SO_REUSEPORT, the Linux kernel distributes connections by default using a 3-tuple hash (protocol + source IP + source port). In CBPF mode, a custom BPF program is attached to the kernel that selects workers based only on client IP address.

#### Effects

| Aspect | Kernel (default) | CBPF |
|--------|------------------|------|
| Distribution Key | protocol + src IP + src port | src IP only |
| Same Client | Varies by source port | Always same worker |
| CPU Cache Efficiency | Medium | High (improved L1/L2 hit rate) |
| TLS Session Resumption | Low-Medium | High (leverages session cache) |

#### Configuration

```toml
[performance]
# "kernel" = kernel default (backward compatibility)
# "cbpf"   = client IP-based CBPF (recommended)
reuseport_balancing = "cbpf"
```

#### Requirements

- **Linux 4.6 or higher** (SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_CBPF support)
- Automatically falls back to kernel default if CBPF attach fails

### Huge Pages (Large OS Pages)

#### Overview

Using Huge Pages (2MB) with the mimalloc allocator reduces TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) misses and improves performance.

#### Effects

| Aspect | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| TLB Misses | Significantly reduced (fewer page table lookups) |
| Page Faults | Reduced when using large amounts of memory |
| Performance | 5-10% improvement (workload dependent) |
| kTLS/splice | Especially effective with kernel integration |

#### Configuration

```toml
[performance]
huge_pages_enabled = true
```

#### OS-Level Configuration (Linux)

```bash
# Temporarily enable Huge Pages (128 pages = 256MB)
echo 128 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages

# Persist (/etc/sysctl.conf)
echo "vm.nr_hugepages=128" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p

# Check current Huge Pages status
grep -i huge /proc/meminfo
```

#### Container Environment Notes

In Docker/Kubernetes environments, Huge Pages must be reserved on the host side:

```bash
# Reserve Huge Pages on host
echo 128 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages

# When starting Docker (optional)
docker run --shm-size=256m ...

# Kubernetes (add to Pod spec)
# resources.limits.hugepages-2Mi: "256Mi"
```

If Huge Pages are unavailable, automatically falls back to regular 4KB pages.

### System Configuration

```bash
# File descriptor limit
ulimit -n 65535

# Kernel parameters
sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=65535
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog=65535
sysctl -w net.core.netdev_max_backlog=65535

# io_uring settings (as needed)
sysctl -w kernel.io_uring_setup_flags=0
```

### Buffer Sizes and Timeouts

Constants in code (set at compile time, requires rebuild):

```rust
// Buffer sizes
const BUF_SIZE: usize = 65536;           // 64KB - optimal size for io_uring
const HEADER_BUF_CAPACITY: usize = 512;  // For HTTP headers
const MAX_HEADER_SIZE: usize = 8192;     // 8KB - header size limit
const MAX_BODY_SIZE: usize = 10485760;   // 10MB - body size limit

// Timeouts
const READ_TIMEOUT: Duration = Duration::from_secs(30);   // Read timeout
const WRITE_TIMEOUT: Duration = Duration::from_secs(30);  // Write timeout
const CONNECT_TIMEOUT: Duration = Duration::from_secs(10); // Backend connection timeout
const IDLE_TIMEOUT: Duration = Duration::from_secs(60);   // Keep-Alive idle timeout
```

> **Note**: Some timeouts can be individually adjusted from config.toml via per-route security settings using `client_header_timeout_secs` and `backend_connect_timeout_secs`.

## Benchmarking

```bash
# Benchmark using wrk
wrk -t4 -c100 -d30s https://localhost/

# Comparison with kTLS enabled/disabled

# 1. kTLS disabled (using rustls)
cargo build --release
./veil -c ./config.toml &
wrk -t4 -c100 -d30s https://localhost/

# 2. kTLS enabled (using rustls + ktls2)
cargo build --release --features ktls
# Set ktls_enabled = true in config.toml
./veil -c ./config.toml &
wrk -t4 -c100 -d30s https://localhost/
```

## Graceful Shutdown

When receiving SIGINT (Ctrl+C) or SIGTERM, the server terminates safely:

1. Stop accepting new connections
2. Complete processing of existing requests
3. Wait for all worker threads to finish
4. Terminate process

```bash
# Start server
./veil -c ./config.toml &

# Terminate safely
kill -SIGTERM $!
# or Ctrl+C
```

## Graceful Reload (Hot Reload)

When receiving SIGHUP, the server reloads the configuration file.
Existing connections are not interrupted, and new settings apply to new connections.

### Behavior

1. Receive SIGHUP signal
2. Reload config file specified at startup
3. Validate configuration
4. Lock-free configuration update via `ArcSwap`
5. New connections use new settings

> **Note**: On reload, the path specified with `-c` option at startup (or default `/etc/veil/config.toml`) is used.

```bash
# Edit config file
vim config.toml

# Reload configuration (zero downtime)
kill -SIGHUP $(pgrep veil)
```

### Supported Changes

| Item | Hot Reload Supported |
|------|---------------------|
| Routing configuration | ✅ |
| Security configuration | ✅ |
| Upstream configuration | ✅ |
| TLS certificates | ❌ |
| Listen address | ❌ (requires restart) |
| Worker thread count | ❌ (requires restart) |

## WebSocket Support

Supports WebSocket (RFC 6455) proxying.
Automatically detects `Connection: Upgrade` and `Upgrade: websocket` headers
and performs bidirectional data transfer.

### Behavior

1. Detect Upgrade request from client
2. Forward Upgrade request to backend
3. Receive 101 Switching Protocols
4. Start bidirectional bypass transfer (operates in configured polling mode)
5. Continue until either connection closes

### Polling Modes

Control polling behavior during WebSocket bidirectional transfer via configuration.

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `adaptive` (default) | Short during data transfer, longer when idle | General purpose, CPU efficiency focused |
| `fixed` | Always uses fixed timeout | Real-time games, low latency priority |

See the "[WebSocket Configuration](#websocket-configuration)" section for detailed configuration options.

### Configuration Examples

WebSocket is automatically supported with regular Proxy backends:

```toml
# WebSocket application (default settings)
[path_routes."example.com"."/ws/"]
type = "Proxy"
url = "http://localhost:3000"

# Low latency configuration (for real-time games)
[path_routes."game.example.com"."/ws/"]
type = "Proxy"
url = "http://localhost:3001"

  [path_routes."game.example.com"."/ws/".security]
  websocket_poll_mode = "fixed"
  websocket_poll_timeout_ms = 1
```

### Supported Backends

| Protocol | Support |
|----------|---------|
| HTTP → WS | ✅ |
| HTTPS → WSS | ✅ |

## Load Balancing

Supports request distribution to multiple backend servers.

### Algorithms

| Algorithm | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `round_robin` | Distribute in order (default) | General purpose |
| `least_conn` | Select server with fewest connections | Long-lived connections |
| `ip_hash` | Hash by client IP | Session persistence |

### Configuration Examples

```toml
# Define upstream group (string format)
[upstreams."backend-pool"]
algorithm = "round_robin"
servers = [
  "http://localhost:8080",
  "http://localhost:8081",
  "http://localhost:8082"
]

# Reference upstream in route
[path_routes."example.com"."/api/"]
type = "Proxy"
upstream = "backend-pool"  # Specify upstream instead of URL
```

#### HTTPS Backends with SNI Name

Specify SNI name for HTTPS backends using IP addresses:

```toml
# HTTPS backend pool (mixed struct and string formats)
[upstreams."https-api-pool"]
algorithm = "least_conn"
servers = [
  # Struct format: IP address + SNI name specification
  { url = "https://192.168.1.100:443", sni_name = "api.internal.example.com" },
  { url = "https://192.168.1.101:443", sni_name = "api.internal.example.com" },
  # String format: domain name specification (SNI name automatically uses URL hostname)
  "https://api.example.com:443"
]
```

### Compatibility with Single Backend

The traditional `url` specification continues to work:

```toml
# Traditional single backend specification
[path_routes."example.com"."/simple/"]
type = "Proxy"
url = "http://localhost:8080"
```

## Health Check

Monitors backend server health and automatically excludes unhealthy servers.

### Behavior

1. Periodically sends HTTP requests in a background thread
2. Checks response status codes
3. Excludes server when consecutive failures reach threshold
4. Restores server when consecutive successes reach threshold

### Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `interval_secs` | Check interval (seconds) | 10 |
| `path` | Path to check | `/` |
| `timeout_secs` | Timeout (seconds) | 5 |
| `healthy_statuses` | Status codes considered successful | [200, 201, 202, 204, 301, 302, 304] |
| `unhealthy_threshold` | Consecutive failures to mark unhealthy | 3 |
| `healthy_threshold` | Consecutive successes to mark healthy | 2 |

### Configuration Example

```toml
[upstreams."api-servers"]
algorithm = "least_conn"
servers = [
  "http://api1.internal:8080",
  "http://api2.internal:8080",
  "http://api3.internal:8080"
]

  [upstreams."api-servers".health_check]
  interval_secs = 10
  path = "/health"
  timeout_secs = 5
  healthy_statuses = [200]
  unhealthy_threshold = 3
  healthy_threshold = 2
```

### Log Output

Health status changes are logged:

```
[INFO] Upstream api1.internal:8080 is now unhealthy
[INFO] Upstream api1.internal:8080 is now healthy
```

## Configuration File Validation

Performs detailed validation of the configuration file at startup and outputs clear error messages if problems are found.

### Validation Items

| Item | Check Content |
|------|---------------|
| TLS Certificate | File existence check |
| TLS Private Key | File existence check |
| Listen Address | Valid socket address format |
| Upstream URL | Valid URL format |
| Proxy URL | Valid URL format |
| File Path | File/directory existence check |
| File Mode | `sendfile` or `memory` |

### Error Message Examples

```
Error: TLS certificate file not found: /path/to/cert.pem
Error: Invalid proxy URL for route 'example.com:/api/': invalid-url
Error: Upstream 'backend-pool' not found
```

## Logging Configuration

Provides high-performance async logging using ftlog. ftlog internally uses a background thread and channel, minimizing impact on worker threads.

### Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `level` | Log level (trace/debug/info/warn/error/off) | info |
| `format` | Log output format (text/json) | text |
| `channel_size` | Internal channel buffer size | 100000 |
| `flush_interval_ms` | Disk flush interval (milliseconds) | 1000 |
| `max_log_size` | Maximum log file size (bytes, 0=unlimited) | 104857600 |
| `file_path` | Log file path (defaults to stderr if unspecified) | none |

### Log Output Formats

#### Text Format (Default)

```
2024-01-01 00:00:00.000+00 0ms INFO main [main.rs:123] Server started
```

#### JSON Format

Suitable for integration with structured log collection systems (Elasticsearch, Loki, etc.).

```json
{"timestamp":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","level":"INFO","target":"veil","file":"main.rs","line":123,"message":"Server started"}
```

### Configuration Example

```toml
[logging]
level = "info"
format = "text"  # or "json"
channel_size = 100000
flush_interval_ms = 1000
file_path = "/var/log/veil.log"
```

### JSON Format Configuration Example

```toml
[logging]
level = "info"
format = "json"
file_path = "/var/log/veil.json"
```

## Self-Sandboxing

This server has built-in **self-isolation from within the code** without using external tools like bubblewrap.

### Why In-Code Implementation Instead of External Tools?

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| bubblewrap (external) | Flexible configuration, existing tool | Additional dependency, configuration complexity |
| **This server (built-in)** | Zero dependencies, declared in code, automatic inheritance | Linux kernel dependent |

### Implemented Self-Isolation Features

#### 1. Landlock Filesystem Restriction (Linux 5.13+)

Process can declare "from now on, I will only access these directories."

```toml
[security]
enable_landlock = true
landlock_read_paths = ["/etc/veil", "/usr", "/lib", "/lib64"]
landlock_write_paths = ["/var/log/veil"]
```

**Supported ABI Versions:**

| ABI | Kernel | Features |
|-----|--------|----------|
| v1 | 5.13+ | Basic filesystem access control |
| v2 | 5.19+ | File reference permission (REFER) |
| v3 | 6.2+ | TRUNCATE permission |
| v4 | 6.7+ | ioctl permission |

#### 2. seccomp System Call Restriction

Restricts system calls based on an allow list.

```toml
[security]
enable_seccomp = true
seccomp_mode = "filter"  # "log" / "filter" / "strict"
```

**Recommended Deployment Procedure:**

```bash
# 1. First verify with log mode
enable_seccomp = true
seccomp_mode = "log"

# 2. Check blocked system calls
journalctl -f | grep -i seccomp

# 3. Switch to filter mode if no issues
seccomp_mode = "filter"
```

#### 3. Privilege Dropping

After starting as root and creating listeners, drop to unprivileged user.

```toml
[security]
drop_privileges_user = "veil"
drop_privileges_group = "veil"
```

### About Namespace Isolation

> **Note**: Namespace isolation like `unshare(CLONE_NEWNET)` is **not recommended** for reverse proxies.
> Isolating the network namespace will break proxy functionality.
> 
> If namespace isolation is required, we recommend doing it at the **systemd level** (see below).

## Security Hardening (systemd Sandboxing)

io_uring is a powerful async I/O interface, but if exploited, it poses a risk of kernel privilege escalation.
This server can achieve robust security when combined with systemd's sandboxing features.

### systemd Service File

A sandbox-enabled service file is provided at `contrib/systemd/veil.service`.

#### Installation

```bash
# 1. Create dedicated user
sudo useradd -r -s /sbin/nologin veil

# 2. Create directories
sudo mkdir -p /etc/veil
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/veil
sudo chown veil:veil /var/log/veil

# 3. Copy configuration files
sudo cp config.toml /etc/veil/
sudo cp server.crt server.key /etc/veil/
sudo chmod 600 /etc/veil/server.key
sudo chown -R veil:veil /etc/veil

# 4. Install binary
sudo cp target/release/veil /usr/local/bin/

# 5. Install service file
sudo cp contrib/systemd/veil.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# 6. Enable and start service
sudo systemctl enable veil
sudo systemctl start veil
```

#### Important Configuration Items

SystemCallFilter=sched_setaffinity sched_getaffinity
SystemCallErrorNumber=EPERM
```

### Enabling Huge Pages

To maximize io_uring and mimalloc performance, enable Huge Pages.

```bash
# 1. Reserve Huge Pages (128 * 2MB = 256MB)
echo 128 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages

# 2. Persist
echo "vm.nr_hugepages=128" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/99-veil.conf
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-veil.conf

# 3. Remove MEMLOCK limit in systemd
# Set LimitMEMLOCK=infinity in veil.service
```

### Security Verification

How to verify the service's security state:

```bash
# Verify configuration with systemd-analyze
systemd-analyze security veil.service

# Check running security state
cat /proc/$(pgrep veil)/status | grep -E "Seccomp|NoNewPrivs|CapBnd"

# Expected output:
# Seccomp:        2                    # seccomp filter enabled
# NoNewPrivs:     1                    # Cannot gain new privileges
# CapBnd:         0000000000000c00     # Only CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
```

### Troubleshooting

#### io_uring Not Working

```bash
# Cause: System calls being blocked
# Solution: Add io_uring_* to SystemCallFilter
journalctl -u veil | grep -i "seccomp"

# Manual test
sudo strace -f -e trace=io_uring_setup /usr/local/bin/veil -c /etc/veil/config.toml
```

#### Memory Lock Failure

```bash
# Cause: MEMLOCK limit too low
# Solution: Set LimitMEMLOCK=infinity
cat /proc/$(pgrep veil)/limits | grep "locked memory"
```

#### Cannot Bind to Privileged Ports (443/80)

```bash
# Cause: Missing CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
# Solution 1: Configure in systemd
#   AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE

# Solution 2: Grant capability to binary
sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/local/bin/veil
```

### Alternative: Using with bubblewrap

For stricter isolation, combine systemd with bubblewrap:

```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bwrap \
    --ro-bind /usr /usr \
    --ro-bind /lib /lib \
    --ro-bind /lib64 /lib64 \
    --ro-bind /etc/veil /etc/veil \
    --bind /var/log/veil /var/log/veil \
    --unshare-pid \
    --die-with-parent \
    /usr/local/bin/veil -c /etc/veil/config.toml
```

In this configuration, systemd creates the outer "container" and bubblewrap provides an even stricter filesystem view.
